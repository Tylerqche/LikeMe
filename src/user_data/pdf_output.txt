Understanding this technology provides \nvaluable insight into the future of communication and its potential applications . \nOverview of Natural Language Processing (NLP)  \nDefinition :  \nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is a field \nof artificial intelligence that focuses on the \ninteraction between computers and human \n(natural) languages, enabling computers to \nunderstand, interpret, and generate human \nlanguage.  \nNLP involves three main steps: tokenizing, \nsem antic understanding and contextual \nawareness.  Key Components  (Figure 1) : \n• Tokenization  (Word Vector Coding) : \nBreaking down sentences into words \nor sub words . \n• Semantic Understanding (Analysis) : \nGrasping the meaning behind words \nand phrases.  \n• Contextual Awareness (Prediction) : \nRecognizing the role of context in \nconversation to generate \nappropriate responses.  \nFigure 1  \n \n', 'Gao, Bo.

They achiev e this by \nfocusing on attention mechanisms  (e.g., \nsee Figure 2) that capture the relationships \nbetween words, regardless of their distance \nfrom one another in a sentence.   Key components of transformer  (Figure 2) : \n• Self-Attention Mechanism : Enables \nthe model to weigh the importance \nof different words in a sentence \nrelative to one another.  \n• Positional Encoding : Provides the \nmodel with information about the \norder of words, since transformers \ndon’t inherently understand word \norder.  \n• Encoder -Decoder Structure : Used to \nprocess input data and generate an \noutput, though ChatGPT uses only \nthe decoder part for language \ngeneration\nFigure 2  \n \nNassiri, Khalid & Akhloufi, Moulay.

Tokens can be words, subwords, or even characters, \ndepending on the complexity of the model. For example, "ChatGPT is awesome" might \nbe split into  tokens like ["Chat", "G", "PT", "is", "awesome"] . This process is a fundamental \npart of Natural Language Processing (NLP) , which helps computers understand human \nlanguage by simplifying it.  \n• Positional Encodings : After tokenization, the model applies posit ional encodings  to the \ntokens. Since transformers don\'t inherently understand the order of words (unlike \nrecurrent neural networks), positional encodings provide information about the position \nof each token in the sentence. This ensures the model knows the  difference between \nsentences like “The cat sat on the mat” and “On the mat, sat the cat.”  \n• Transformer Layers : The tokenized and encoded input is then passed through multiple \ntransformer layers . Each layer processes the tokens, understanding the relationships \nbetween them and building up a representation of the sentence. The transformer \narchitecture, at its core, is a type of neural network , specifically designed to handle \nsequences of data (lik e text) more efficiently than previous models like recurrent neural \nnetworks (RNNs).  \nFigure 3  \n \nLi, Shoubin & Wang, Qing.

It assigns \nattention scores  that indicate how important each word is in relation to others. For \nexample, in the sent ence “The cat sat on the mat,” the word “cat” might get a higher \nattention score in relation to “sat” than “the,” because “cat” and “sat” are more \ncontextually linked.  \n• Why Attention is Important : This allows the model to focus on the most relevant parts \nof a sentence, no matter how far apart the words are. Unlike earlier models that \nstruggled to capture long -term dependencies in language, transformers can “attend” to \nimportant words throughout an entire sequence.  \n• Transformer Architecture : The self -attention  mechanism, combined with the \ntransformer’s deep neural network structure, enables the model to process input data \nin parallel, making it both faster and more accurate than previous models. Each \ntransformer layer consists of these attention mechanisms and fully connected layers \nthat fine -tune the information passed along  (e.g., see Figure 4) , gradually building a \nmore complete understanding of the input.  \nFigure 4  \n \n', 'Goldstein, Ariel & Zada, Zaid & Buchnik, Eliav  & Schain, Mariano & Price, Amy & Aubrey, Bobbi & Nastase, Samuel \n& Feder, Amir & Emanuel, Dotan & Cohen, Alon & Jansen, Aren & Gazula, Harshvardhan & Choe, Gina & Rao, Aditi \n& Kim, Catherine & Casto, Colton & Fanda, Lora & Doyle, Werner & Friedman, Daniel  & Hasson, Uri.

Nature Neuroscience. 25. \n369-380. 10.1038/s41593 -022-01026 -4. \nGenerating the Response  \nOnce the model has processed the input through several  transformer layers, it moves to the \ntask of generating a response.  \n• Prediction : Based on the internal representation of the input, ChatGPT uses its Large \nLanguage Model (LLM)  capabilities to predict the next token (word or sub  word) that is \nmost likely to f ollow. This is where the power of neural networks comes in —because the \nmodel has been trained on vast amounts of text data, it has learned to generate \nresponses that are fluent and contextually appropriate.  \n• Step -by-Step Prediction : The response generation process is sequential. The model \npredicts one token at a time. After predicting the first token, it uses that token as part of \nthe input to predict the next one. This continues until a full response is generated. For \nexample, if the input was “ Write me a s tory”, the model might predict tokens like \n“Once, ” “upon ,” “a,” “time ,” (Figure 5)  and so on, until the response is complete.  \n• Probability Distribution : At each step, the model doesn’t just pick any token randomly. \nIt uses a probability distribution  (e.g., see Figure 4) to dete rmine the most suitable \ntoken. The model assigns a probability to each possible next token based on the input \ncontext, and the token with the highest probability is chosen. This ensures that the \ngenerated text is both coherent and contextually appropriate.  \nFigure 5 \n \nShanahan, Murray & McDonell, Kyle & Reynolds, Laria. (2023).

The model, as a Large Language Model (LLM) , then predicts the most likely response \nby selecting words based on probability. This seamless integration allows ChatGPT to generate \naccurate and coherent text in a human -like manner.
